<div id="appearance"></div> <h4>Appearance</h4>
<p> Box N Bot appears as a poorly made Paint 3D model, he has a weirdly-shaped head with two miss-shapen on eyes and a frown, he also has some form of gray antenna with a red tip sticking out from the 'top' of his head. His body is made up of thick blue tubes. He has two chubby boxing gloves as hands each with a stubby thumb and has two short wheels that he uses to get around. </p>
