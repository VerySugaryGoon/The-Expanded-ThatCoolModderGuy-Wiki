<p>Trade Guy appears as a poorly edited version of an It's A Bully model. He looks almost the same outside of changed colors and added items, such as his pants being yellow, his undershirt being yellow, his tank-top being red, his large "Lets trade!" sign that sits in front of him and the gray dodecahedron he holds.</p>
