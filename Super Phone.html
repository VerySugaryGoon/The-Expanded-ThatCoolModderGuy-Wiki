It's shell is green with small blue text that reads "this is a super phone!" on it, a small blue screen with a waving Sticky saying "hi!" on it, seemingly randomly sized number buttons (0-9), and a large blue diamond-shaped button with 3D text on it that says "CALL!". </p>
<p> (Paint 3D/Fangame) Super Phone appears as a huge, poorly modeled phone. It's shell is green with orange text that reads "token please" on it, a small white screen with a Sticky on it with a shocked expression, and seemingly randomly sized and colored number buttons (0-9). </p>
<p> (3D Movie Maker) Super Phone appears as a huge, poorly drawn phone. It's shell is green with red-green text that reads "Hello!" on it, a blue white screen with a Sticky waving on it, and large red button with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10, on it. </p>
