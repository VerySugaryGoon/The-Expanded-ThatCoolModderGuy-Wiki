<p>Moldy's Alarm Clock appears as a poorly modeled Alarm Clock, it has two yellow bells poking out from the top on each side, and two small black legs. It's main "body" is a large white screen with the text "TIME" on it and four small thick black lines on said green on the left, right, top, and bottom, of the screen. The screen itself is blue-rimmed.</p>
