<div id="appearance"></div> <h4>Appearance</h4>
<p>PLAY_TIME_2_0 appears as a poorly modeled, robot version of Playtime from Baldi's Basics. She "wears" a red dress, light blue paints, and brown shoes. Her dress has the text "this is actually paint not a dress" on it. Her would-be skin is a shiny metal. She has two big, misshapen eyes that change color, a pointy nose, a bald head, and a hinge-like mouth.</p>
