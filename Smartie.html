<div id="appearance"></div> <h4>Appearance</h4>
<p> Smartie appears as a poorly drawn alien-robot(?) sort of entity. He has two bug-like eyes that sit atop long stems that come out of his plate-like head and an exposed brain sat ontop of a plate-like head part of his body. His lower body is a laptop while his upper body is blue with buttons and a speaker on it. He has four arms and two legs, with them being stickman-like in how they appear. </p>

<li>Smartie is still most likely the Player replacement in the 3D Movie Maker version of SIFWN despite having no assets or audio in said version.</li>
<li>Smartie is bad at math.</li>
<li>Smartie is replaced by Kid in the SIFWN Fangame.</li>

<li>Smartie dislikes both Squidward and Box N Bot.</li>
<li>Smartie is friends with Mr. Smiles, Push N Learn, and The Hand Man but gets along okay with most of the cast as well.</li>
