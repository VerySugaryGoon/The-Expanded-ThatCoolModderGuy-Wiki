His nose is oddly shaped, his eyebrows are thick. He has a smug expression. He wears red pants, brown shoes, and a blue shirt that has the text; "dont trust this guy!!!!!!!!!!!!" on it. He holds a cardboard box with text on it that reads; "best gift!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!". One of his eyes is much larger than the other.</p>
