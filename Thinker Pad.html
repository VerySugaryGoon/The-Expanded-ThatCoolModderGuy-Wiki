<p>It appears as a poorly modeled tablet of sorts, it has a dark blue frame and a dark gray number pad on the side, it has some form of green and purple antenna sticking out from the top along with a black cone sticking out from the top of the other side. Dark red text on the top of the blue part reads "Thinker Pad". It has six screens, three are used to display if answers are correct or wrong, one is used for the Player to enter an answer, the largest one is used to display the math problem, and the one in the lower left displays Moldy's camera. The Buttons on the number pad look just like the ones on the You Can Think Pad.</p>
